# Mangabot
[![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)](LICENSE)


A Discord bot made to help keep track of Manga from across several sources. Mainly being used by me and my friends on a private discord server. Still in early development

# To Do List
- [x] Search for a specific manga
    - [ ] Search for manga by tags
    - [ ] Return list of manga when exact match cant be found
- [x] Find random Manga
- [ ] Ping users when manga's they read are updated
- [ ] Return magna statistics
- [ ] Swap from prefix calls to / commands
- [ ] Add logger
- [ ] Add more documentation
- [ ] Polish README.md
- [ ] Write tests(bleh)
- [ ] Dockerize
- [ ] TBD


# Additional Information
If anyone is going to pull and run this bot for their own server make sure to add in a BotConstants.py file. Thats where the token and prefix information will be held. This might change later on.

# Special Thanks 
Special thanks to vaughnw128. If it wasnt for him development would've taken alot longer.
